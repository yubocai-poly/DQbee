We provide the artifact evaluation for the paper. We list the code resourses and the corresponding results in the following list:
- Figure 1 in Example 2 in the paper: [[Jupyter Notebook]](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/DQbee/blob/main/Examples/simulation_unstable.ipynb).

- Implementation of Algorithm 1 in the paper: [[code]](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/DQbee/blob/main/DQbee/DQuadratization.py#L88).

- Implementation of Algorithm 2 in the paper: [[code]](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/DQbee/blob/main/DQbee/DQuadratization.py#L591).

- Example 5 in the paper: [[Jupyter Notebook]](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/DQbee/blob/main/Examples/MultiStability/multistability_system_2.ipynb).

- Section 5.1 - Application to reachability analysis: [[Julia Code]](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/DQbee/tree/main/Examples/Reachability). Plots of the results are shown in the file [[results]](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/DQbee/tree/main/Examples/Reachability/results). In order to execute the program of the reachability analysis, please run the [[start.ipynb]](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/DQbee/blob/main/Examples/Reachability/startup.ipynb).

- Section 5.2 - Small bistable model: resource is shown in the file [[Bistability]](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/DQbee/tree/main/Examples/BiStability).
